## Classic Arcade Game

### About the game
This is a classic arcade game, often called Frogger. A bit old fashioned game, but a lot of fun :)

### Loading the game
To load the game you can either download the ZIP from my repository or clone it to your local repository from my GitHub account. Once it is downloaded, you should just open the .html file in your browser, and enjoy the game. 


### Playing the game
You can use the 'down', 'up', 'left', and 'right' arrow keys to move the player to these four directions. The goal is to reach the water. You get a point if you succeed. But watch out for bugs. If you collide with them, you lose a point. If you reach the water or collide with the enemies, you get back to the grass in both cases. But you get a score if you made it to the water, and lose a point if you collided with enemies.
